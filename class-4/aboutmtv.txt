Good question...it's been asked alot lately.

First of all, this site is _NOT_ sponsored in anyway by MTV Networks, although
they _ARE_ aware of my endeavours and support it.

My name is Adam Curry, I have been an on-air talent (VJ) with MTV for the past
6 years. I've been living a second life in cyberspace for about the same period
of time, and have taken it upon myself to put this site on-line, with all
expenses coming out of my own pocket. Don't feel bad, I make enough at my
"real" job.

This site will always remain free to the internet community, something that
might not be the case would MTV be running it themselves I'm afraid, but that's
their business.

Anyway, to make a long story short, this is my hobby, and you get what you pay
for when you connect to this server. Within the next couple of weeks/months you
should see alot of cool stuff coming online here, including video and audio
stuff that will absolutely blow you away!

Okay some technical details about this site:

MTV.com is run on a Sun 3, that is connected to the Internet via a T1 provided
by Digital Express in Maryland. There are no local disks on this machine,
however there is close to 1 gig of NFS attached disk. Due to the explosive
growth of accesses to this site in recent months, we will be upgrading MTV.com
to a Sparc 10 sometime in the next month or so. This should result in a very
noticeable increase in performance for all you folks out in netland.
